#  tc uses the following units when passed as a parameter.
#    kbps: Kilobytes per second
#    mbps: Megabytes per second
#    gbps: Gigabits per second
#    kbit: Kilobits per second
#    mbit: Megabits per second
#    gbit: Gigabits per second
#    bps: Bytes per second
#  Amounts of data can be specified in:
#    kb or k: Kilobytes
#    mb or m: Megabytes
#    gb or g: Gigabytes

# RED: Used for determining how fast the average queue size is influenced by the real queue size.
# Larger values make the calculation more sluggish, allowing longer bursts of traffic before
# marking starts. Real life experiments support the following guideline: (min+min+max)/(3*avpkt). 
BURST=9217

# RED Hard limit on the real (not average) queue size in bytes. Further packets are dropped. Should be set higher than
# max+burst. It is advised to set this a few times higher than max.
